# Machine Learning App with Streamlit
An application to predict profit <br>
This project is a Machine Learning App built using Streamlit, designed to analyze CSV files, perform data preprocessing, and predict outcomes using Linear Regression. The app allows users to upload a dataset, explore it through visualizations, clean and preprocess the data, and train a machine learning model to make predictions<br>
**Features**<br>
1. Data Visualization<br>
Interactive Filters: Filter data based on categorical and numerical columns.<br>
Graphical Visualizations: Generate various types of plots (scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, histograms) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.<br>
Pie Charts and Bar Plots: Visualize the distribution of categorical data and their relationship with the target variable.<br>
2. Data Cleaning<br>
Missing Value Handling: Options to replace missing values with mean, median, mode, or delete rows with missing values.<br>
Encoding Categorical Variables: Supports One-Hot Encoding, Binary Encoding, and Label Encoding.<br>
Normalization: Apply normalization techniques like MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, MaxAbsScaler, and RobustScaler<br>
3. Dimensionality Reduction<br>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information.<br>
4. Machine Learning<br>
Linear Regression: Train a linear regression model to predict the target variable.<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like MSE, MAE, R2 Score, and RMSE.<br>
Prediction: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.<br>
5. User-Friendly Interface<br>
Interactive Widgets: Sliders, dropdowns, and buttons for easy interaction.<br>
Tabs for Organization: Separate tabs for visualization, data cleaning, and prediction.<br>
Dynamic Updates: Real-time updates based on user inputs.<br>
